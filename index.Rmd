## What is Moore's Law?

1. Computer processors become twice as fast every 18 months.
2. _The number of transistors we can fit on a processor chip doubles every 18 months._
3. Bandwidth on the interenet doubles every 18 months.
4. The number of users on the internet doubles every 18 months.

*** .hint
Gordon Moore is a co-founder of Intel, which makes processors.

*** .explanation
Moore's law is commonly misunderstood to apply to the speed of computers, which is technically incorrect (althought it captures the sense of his principle).

When I came to USM, we were using groupwise and not gmail.
How much space is on the maine.edu gmail drives? 30Gb and keeps going up
Why are we still doing this?

## Five Component Model

![Five Component Model](../assets/img/fig01_05.jpg)

*** =pnotes
Think about a company like Uber.  
What industry is it displacing? Taxis.  
What became more automated? Hailing, transactions
What value is added? Lower cost, driver rating, passenger rating
Why is Uber so highly valued? Data.
What are some issues? Regulation.
Uber's information systems rely on all of the above. Take one tiny example...the rating system. The more people use it, the better the user experience becomes.

## Ethics Guide - Which graph should you use?

![Figure 1-3](../assets/img/fig1_3.jpg)

1. Figure 1
2. Figure 2
3. _Figure 3_

*** .hint
Unless you have good reason, truncating the y axis is usually a bad choice.

*** .explanation
Figures 1 and 2 visually overstate the growth rate. Figure 1 is worse because there are no units shown.
